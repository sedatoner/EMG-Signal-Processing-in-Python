# EMG-Signal-Processing-in-Python
Visualization and RMS Feature Extraction
This project demonstrates basic signal processing on surface EMG (Electromyography) data using Python.
It includes signal visualization and RMS  feature extraction using a sliding window approach.

- Plot raw EMG waveform
- Compute RMS over time using sliding window
- Visualize RMS values to show muscle activation trends

- This project is for signal analysis only. No classification or machine learning is included yet.
- Useful for exploring EMG recordings, identifying active regions, or preparing features for future ML tasks.

- Biomedical signal research
- EMG analysis in sports or rehabilitation
- Preprocessing for gesture recognition projects
